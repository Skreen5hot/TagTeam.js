This application is a sophisticated, client-side Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline written in JavaScript. It transitions from basic lexical analysis (Parts of Speech) to high-level **Semantic Graph Generation** and **Linked Data** integration.

The app is designed to transform unstructured text into a structured knowledge graph that machines can understand, potentially for use in ontologies or knowledge bases.

## 🏗️ Architecture: The 5-Stage Pipeline

The application processes text through a linear "cascade" where each stage adds a layer of intelligence.

### 1. The POSTagger (Lexical Analysis)

The engine begins by breaking a sentence into tokens and assigning a **Part of Speech (POS) Tag** to each word (e.g., `VB` for Verb, `NN` for Noun).

* **Contraction Handling:** It intelligently expands words like "don't" into "do" and "not" before tagging.
* **Contextual Rules Engine:** Unlike simple lookups, it uses a rules engine to disambiguate words based on neighbors (e.g., determining if "that" is a Relative Pronoun or a Determiner).

### 2. Lemmatization (Normalization)

The `Lemmatizer` class reduces words to their "dictionary form."

* **Example:** "scripts" becomes "script," "support" remains "support," and "running" becomes "run."
* This ensures that the semantic graph remains consistent even if the user uses different tenses or pluralities.

### 3. Grammatical Chunking (Syntactic Grouping)

Instead of looking at isolated words, the app groups them into **Chunks**:

* **NP (Noun Phrases):** "This set of scripts"
* **VP (Verb Phrases):** "jointly support"
* This creates the "nodes" of the eventual graph.

### 4. Dependency Parsing (Relational Mapping)

The `DependencyParser` uses a **pattern-matching engine** to find how chunks relate to one another. It looks for specific sequences:

* **Subject-Verb:** Connects a Noun Phrase to a Verb Phrase.
* **Verb-Object:** Connects the action to the thing being acted upon.
* **Passive Voice Detection:** It can recognize if a sentence is passive (e.g., "was generated by") and flip the relationship to find the true "agent."

### 5. Wikidata Linking (Semantic Grounding)

The most advanced feature is the `WikidataLinker`. It attempts to link the text to **Real-World Entities** via the Wikidata API.

* **Resonance Scoring:** It doesn't just pick the first result; it scores candidates based on how well their descriptions match the rest of the sentence.
* **IRI Generation:** It produces Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs), turning plain text into **Linked Open Data**.

## 📊 Knowledge Graph Transformation

The final output is a simplified semantic graph. For the sentence:

> *"This set of scripts jointly support the capability of generating a Word document."*

**The App generates relationships like:**

* `(support) --[nsubj]--> (script)`
* `(support) --[dobj]--> (capability)`
* `(capability) --[vmod]--> (generate)`

## 🛠️ Specialized Services

### GDCService & GDCManager

Beyond simple analysis, the app includes a "Global Data Component" (GDC) layer. This service:

* **Extracts Concepts:** It scans existing JSON-LD data structures.
* **Deduplication:** Uses a `hashCode` function to ensure the same concept (like "Script") isn't created twice.
* **Persistence:** Integrates with **IndexedDB** to save these semantic nodes locally in the browser, allowing for a persistent, searchable knowledge base without a backend server.

## Summary of Key Classes

| Class | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| **`POSTagger`** | Tokenizes text and identifies word categories (Noun, Verb, etc.). |
| **`Lemmatizer`** | Normalizes words to their base forms (removes plurals/tenses). |
| **`DependencyParser`** | Maps the logic of the sentence (Who did what to whom?). |
| **`WikidataLinker`** | Connects text to the global Wikidata knowledge base. |
| **`GDCManager`** | Manages the storage and synchronization of the resulting knowledge graph. |
