## Why Archive?

These files are kept because:
1. **Historical record** - Show evolution of project
2. **Reference** - May contain useful patterns or ideas
3. **Learning** - Help understand what didn't work and why
4. **Compliance** - Part of project history

## Cleanup Policy

Files are archived (not deleted) when they are:
- No longer used in production code
- Superseded by better implementations
- Historical documentation of completed phases
- Experimental code that wasn't adopted

**Do not delete archived files** - they're part of the project's history.
