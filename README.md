# TagTeam.js

Welcome to yet another Natural Language Processing project that no one asked for but everyone secretly needed.
TagTeam.js in action https://skreen5hot.github.io/TagTeam.js/

This repo is a **client-side NLP playground** designed for people who:

- Don’t want to deal with server-side dependencies,
- Don’t want to sell their soul (or their data) to some cloud API, and
- Just want to tag some words without accidentally spinning up a Kubernetes cluster.

At its heart, this project uses **jsPOS**, a delightfully lightweight part-of-speech tagger that runs entirely in your browser. It’s basically the IKEA furniture of NLP tools: it comes flat-packed, it “mostly” works, and if something breaks, it’s probably your fault for putting the verbs where the nouns go.

---

### What it does

- Splits your text into words.
- Assigns a **Part of Speech (POS) tag** to each word (noun, verb, adjective… you know, like your 6th grade English teacher tried to get you to remember).
- Shows you the results in a neat little table so you can pretend you’re doing “serious AI work” while really just tagging the word dog for the hundredth time.

---

### What it doesn’t do

- Achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. (Sorry, no Transformer magic here.)
- Make you rich, famous, or instantly good at English grammar.
- Care about your feelings when it calls your writing “adjective soup.”

---

### Why this exists

Because sometimes you just want a simple, offline, zero-setup POS tagger without needing to summon the computational power of a small nation.

If you’re still reading this, congratulations — you now know more about this repo than most people know about their own health insurance plan.
